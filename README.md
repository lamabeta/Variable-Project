# Variable Project

### Objective
The project's main focus is on understanding how to use the variables in Java.

### Problem
Create a program to calculate the area of a rectangle (by multiplying the length and width).
Write a Java program to calculate and display the area of a rectangle. 
> **Hint**: The area is found by multiplying the rectangle’s length by its width.

### Implementation
- Declare two double variables for length and width.
- Assign values to variables.
- Calculate the area.
- Display the result.


```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* add your code here */

    }
}
```
